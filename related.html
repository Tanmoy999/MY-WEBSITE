		<p><b>Autonomous</b><br /><br /> Simply put, autonomy means that an AI construct doesn’t need help from people. Driverless cars illustrate the term 
		“autonomous” in varying degrees. Level four autonomy represents a vehicle that doesn’t need a steering wheel or pedals: it doesn’t need a human 
		inside of it to operate at full capacity. If we ever have a vehicle that can operate without a driver, and also doesn’t need to connect to any grid, 
		server, GPS, or other external source in order to function it’ll have reached level five autonomy. Anything beyond that would be called sentient, 
		and despite the leaps that have been made recently in the field of AI, the singularity (an event representing an AI that becomes self-aware) is purely 
		theoretical at this point.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
		<p><b>Algorithm</b><br /><br /> The most important part of AI is the algorithm. These are math formulas and/or programming commands that inform a 
		regular non-intelligent computer on how to solve problems with artificial intelligence. Algorithms are rules that teach computers how to figure things 
		out on their own. It may be a nerdy construct of numbers and commands, but what algorithms lack in sex appeal they more than make up for in 
		usefulness.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
		<p><b>Machine learning</b><br /><br /> The meat and potatoes of AI is machine learning — in fact it’s typically acceptable to substitute the terms 
		artificial intelligence and machine learning for one another. They aren’t quite the same, however, but connected. Machine learning is the process 
		by which an AI uses algorithms to perform artificial intelligence functions. It’s the result of applying rules to create outcomes through an AI.
		<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
		<p><b>Black box</b><br /><br />
		When the rules are applied an AI does a lot of complex math. This math, often, can’t even be understood by humans (and sometimes it just wouldn’t be 
		worth the time it would take for us to figure it all out) yet the system outputs useful information. When this happens it’s called black box learning. 
		The real work happens in such a way that we don’t really care how the computer arrived at the decisions it’s made, because we know what rules it used 
		to get there. Black box learning is how we can ethically skip “showing our work” like we had to in high school algebra.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
		<p><b>Neural network</b><br /><br />
		When we want an AI to get better at something we create a neural network. These networks are designed to be very similar to the human nervous system 
		and brain. It uses stages of learning to give AI the ability to solve complex problems by breaking them down into levels of data. The first level of 
		the network may only worry about a few pixels in an image file and check for similarities in other files. Once the initial stage is done, the neural 
		network will pass its findings to the next level which will try to understand a few more pixels, and perhaps some metadata. This process continues at 
		every level of a neural network.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
		<p><b>Deep learning</b><br /><br />
		Deep learning is what happens when a neural network gets to work. As the layers process data the AI gains a basic understanding. You might be teaching 
		your AI to understand cats, but once it learns what paws are that AI can apply that knowledge to a different task. Deep learning means that instead of 
		understanding what something is, the AI begins to learn “why.”<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
		<p><b>Natural language processing</b><br /><br />
		It takes an advanced neural network to parse human language. When an AI is trained to interpret human communication it’s called natural language 
		processing. This is useful for chat bots and translation services, but it’s also represented at the cutting edge by AI assistants like Alexa and Siri.
        <br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
		<p><b>Reinforcement learning</b><br /><br />
		AI is a lot more like humans than we might be comfortable believing. We learn in almost the exact same way. One method of teaching a machine, just 
		like a person, is to use reinforcement learning. This involves giving the AI a goal that isn’t defined with a specific metric, such as telling it to 
		“improve efficiency” or “find solutions.” Instead of finding one specific answer the AI will run scenarios and report results, which are then 
		evaluated by humans and judged. The AI takes the feedback and adjusts the next scenario to achieve better results.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
		<p><b>Supervised learning</b><br /><br />
		This is the very serious business of proving things. When you train an AI model using a supervised learning method you provide the machine with the 
		correct answer ahead of time. Basically the AI knows the answer and it knows the question. This is the most common method of training because it 
		yields the most data: it defines patterns between the question and answer. If you want to know why something happens, or how something happens, an AI 
		can look at the data and determine connections using the supervised learning method.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
		<p><b>Unsupervised learning</b><br /><br />
		In many ways the spookiest part of AI research is realizing that the machines are really capable of learning, and they’re using layers upon layers 
		of data and processing capability to do so. With unsupervised learning we don’t give the AI an answer. Rather than finding patterns that are 
		predefined like, “why people choose one brand over another,” we simply feed a machine a bunch of data so that it can find whatever patterns it is 
		able to.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
		<p><b>Transfer learning</b><br /><br />
		Another spooky way machines can learn is through transfer learning. Once an AI has successfully learned something, like how to determine if an image 
		is a cat or not, it can continue to build on it’s knowledge even if you aren’t asking it to learn anything about cats. You could take an AI that can 
		determine if an image is a cat with 90-percent accuracy, hypothetically, and after it spent a week training on identifying shoes it could then return 
		to its work on cats with a noticeable improvement in accuracy.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
		<p><b>Turing Test</b><br /><br />
		If you’re like most AI experts you’re cautiously optimistic about the future and you have reservations about our safety as we draw closer to robots 
		that are indistinguishable from people. Alan Turing shared your concerns. Though he died in 1954 his legacy lives on in two ways. Primarily he’s 
		credited with cracking Nazi codes and helping the Allies win World War 2. He’s also the father of modern computing and the creator of the Turing Test.
		While the test was originally conceived as a way of determining if a human could be fooled by a conversation, in text display only, between a human 
		and an artificial intelligence, it has since become short hand for any AI that can fool a person into believing they’re seeing or interacting with a 
		real person.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
