			<p>APPLICATIONS OF <br />ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE!!</p>
		</div>
	</body>	
		<div id="maintext">
			<p>Artificial intelligence has made its way into a number of areas. Here are few examples:<br /><br />
			<ul><li><b>AI in healthcare</b>-> The biggest bets are on improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. Companies are applying machine learning to make
			better and faster diagnoses than humans. One of the best known healthcare technologies is IBM Watson. It understands natural language and is 
			capable of responding to questions asked of it. The system mines patient data and other available data sources to form a hypothesis, which it 
			then presents with a confidence scoring schema. Other AI applications include chatbots, a computer program used online to answer questions and 
			assist customers, to help schedule follow-up appointments or aid patients through the billing process, and virtual health assistants that provide 
			basic medical feedback.<br /><br /><br /></li>
			<li><b>AI in business</b>-> Robotic process automation is being applied to highly repetitive tasks normally performed by humans. Machine learning 
			algorithms are being integrated into analytics and CRM platforms to uncover information on how to better serve customers. Chatbots have been 
			incorporated into websites to provide immediate service to customers. Automation of job positions has also become a talking point among 
			academics and IT analysts.<br /><br /><br /></li>
			<li><b>AI in education</b>-> AI can automate grading, giving educators more time. AI can assess students and adapt to their needs, helping them 
			work at their own pace. AI tutors can provide additional support to students, ensuring they stay on track. AI could change where and how students 
			learn, perhaps even replacing some teachers.<br /><br /><br /></li>
			<li><b>AI in finance</b>-> AI in personal finance applications, such as Mint or Turbo Tax, is disrupting financial institutions. Applications such 
			as these collect personal data and provide financial advice. Other programs, such as IBM Watson, have been applied to the process of buying a home. 
			Today,  software  performs much of the trading on Wall Street.<br /><br /><br /></li>
			<li><b>AI in law</b>-> The discovery process, sifting through of documents, in law is often overwhelming for humans. Automating this process is a 
			more efficient use of time. Startups are also building question-and-answer computer assistants that can sift programmed-to-answer questions by 
			examining the taxonomy and ontology associated with a database.<br /><br /><br /></li>
			<li><b>AI in manufacturing</b>-> This is an area that has been at the forefront of incorporating robots into the workflow. Industrial robots used 
			to perform single tasks and were separated from human workers, but as the technology advanced that changed .<br /><br /><br /></li>
			<li><b>AI in Gaming</b> −> AI plays crucial role in strategic games such as chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, etc., where machine can think of large 
			number of possible positions based on heuristic knowledge.<br /><br /><br /></li>
			<li><b>AI in Natural Language Processing</b> −> It is possible to interact with the computer that understands natural language spoken by humans.
			<br /><br /><br /></li>
			<li><b>AI in Expert Systems</b> −> There are some applications which integrate machine, software, and special information to impart reasoning and 
			advising. They provide explanation and advice to the users.<br /><br /><br /></li>
			<li><b>AI in Speech Recognition</b> −> Some intelligent systems are capable of hearing and comprehending the language in terms of sentences and 
			their meanings while a human talks to it. It can handle different accents, slang words, noise in the background, change in human’s noise due to 
			cold, etc.<br /><br /><br /></li>
			<li><b>AI in Handwriting Recognition</b> −> The handwriting recognition software reads the text written on paper by a pen or on screen by a stylus. 
			It can recognize the shapes of the letters and convert it into editable text.<br /><br /><br /></li>
			<li><b>AI in making Intelligent Robots</b> −> Robots are able to perform the tasks given by a human. They have sensors to detect physical data 
			from the real world such as light, heat, temperature, movement, sound, bump, and pressure. They have efficient processors, multiple sensors and 
			huge memory, to exhibit intelligence. In addition, they are capable of learning from their mistakes and they can adapt to the new environment.
